        <!-- HERO -->
        <h1 class="technical-title">Technical Architecture</h1>

        <p class="technical-intro">
            The Eonix Smart PDS is engineered as a layered power architecture that
            combines fast analog regulation, hardware-enforced protection, and
            digitally supervised control and telemetry.
        </p>

        <p class="technical-intro">
            All safety-critical behavior is guaranteed in hardware. Software
            configures operating limits, aggregates telemetry, and provides
            system-level visibility.
        </p>

        <!-- INPUT POWER ARCHITECTURE -->
        <div class="technical-block">
            <h2>Input Power Architecture</h2>

            <p>
                The system accepts a wide input voltage range to support common
                battery packs, adapters, and industrial power sources.
            </p>

            <p>
                Input voltage range: <strong>10 V to 25 V</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Hardware under-voltage and over-voltage cutoffs are enforced at
                the input stage. When input limits are violated, the system
                disconnects loads deterministically to protect downstream
                electronics.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- PROTECTION MODEL -->
        <div class="technical-block">
            <h2>Protection & Fault Handling</h2>

            <p>
                Protection mechanisms operate independently of firmware execution
                and communication state.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each channel implements hardware-enforced over-current and
                short-circuit protection. Faults are isolated at the channel
                level and do not propagate across the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Protection events are latched, timestamped, and reported to the
                supervisory controller for user visibility and diagnostics.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- POWER REGULATION -->
        <div class="technical-block">
            <h2>Power Regulation & Channel Control</h2>

            <p>
                Output channels are designed around fast analog control loops
                to ensure stable voltage and current regulation under dynamic
                load conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Where applicable, channels support programmable CC/CV behavior.
                Current limiting is enforced in hardware, not via firmware polling.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each channel can be individually enabled, disabled, and
                configured within predefined safe operating boundaries.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- TELEMETRY -->
        <div class="technical-block">
            <h2>Telemetry & Measurement</h2>

            <p>
                The system continuously measures voltage and current on the
                input and on each output channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                Telemetry data is sampled, aggregated, and made available to
                the user in real time. Electrical state is never inferred —
                it is directly measured.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CONNECTIVITY -->
        <div class="technical-block">
            <h2>Connectivity & User Interface</h2>

            <p>
                A wireless Bluetooth interface provides live access to system
                telemetry and configuration from a mobile device.
            </p>

            <p>
                Users can view real-time voltage and current data, enable or
                disable channels, and receive immediate feedback on system
                state and fault conditions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- LOGGING & ALERTS -->
        <div class="technical-block">
            <h2>Data Logging, Alerts & Visualization</h2>

            <p>
                Telemetry data can be logged over time to capture system behavior
                during operation, testing, or fault events.
            </p>

            <p>
                Logged data is visualized as time-series graphs. Protection
                events and limit violations are explicitly marked on graphs
                to correlate electrical behavior with system faults.
            </p>

            <p>
                When a fault or abnormal condition occurs, the system generates
                immediate alerts to the user through the connected interface.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- NOTE -->
        <div class="technical-note">
            <p>
                Detailed electrical limits, channel ratings, protection thresholds,
                timing characteristics, and block diagrams will be published as
                the platform completes validation and characterization.
            </p>
